# Predicting Fraud in Financial Statements

This is a project that aims to create machine learning based models to detect fraud in financial statements using only the quantitative data from the financial statements. The models are built using financial data of Indian companies for the period 2011-2015.

The analysis can be read [here](https://adromine.github.io/Predicting-Fraud-in-Financial-Statements/Report/dissertation.html).   
A pdf version can be read [here](/PDF/Report_Tufte_Book_Style.pdf).

The built models are not included here due to their large size. They can be rebuilt using the source code provided in the scripts folder.
